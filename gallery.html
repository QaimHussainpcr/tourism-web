                <h3>Snowfall of Parachinar</h3>
                <p>Parachinar is a town located in the Kurram District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in Pakistan. It is
                    situated in a mountainous region and experiences harsh winters with significant snowfall.
                    Snowfall in Parachinar typically occurs during the winter months, usually from November to March,
                    with peak snowfall usually happening in December and January. The amount of snowfall can vary from
                    year to year depending on weather patterns, but it is not uncommon for Parachinar to receive heavy
                    snowfall during the winter season.

                    The snowfall in Parachinar not only adds to the beauty of the landscape but also has significant
                    implications for the local community. It can disrupt transportation, particularly in mountainous
                    areas where roads may become impassable. Additionally, heavy snowfall can also affect daily life,
                    agriculture, and the economy of the region.</p>
